The IPBES assessment process is a lengthy and complex process, spanning over multiple years and involving many contributors and products. It is therefore important to easily track and find files related to the assessment. Here, an IPBES specific file name scheme for the assessments is being proposed.

Files used in IPBES should be named in a consistent and standardised way, while simultaneously informing about the content of the file, to avoid file loss and increase findability of the files, transparency of the final assessments, and reusability. For example, using the filename `Fig3.8` or `ILK dialogue meeting Asia` seems to be informative, but when a user is interested in ILK dialogue meeting reports, it is unclear from which assessment the report comes and when the dialogue meeting took place, and when a user finds ‘Fig3.8’ in the download folder on their computer, the file name does not provide any indication of the contents and topic of that file. Having a standardised way to create file names improves the transparency and findability of information, and also avoids file names like `DMR_systematic_review_final_final_JS_final_approved`.

Apart from human understanding, the possibility to parse the file names automatically and deduce information about the file is an important second aspect of the naming conventions.

The recommended naming of files is built up in a similar way as the IBAN codes used by banks, and the proposed file name convention for IPBES products is: 

**IPBES\_[assessment abbreviation]\_[chapter]\_[document type]\_[short description]\_[version]**

In detail:
**All sections are required to be filled in.**

IPBES: The acronym IPBES should be always present (in capital letters)

[assessment_abbreviation]: the abbreviation of the assessment as was **approved during the scoping of the assessment**, e.g., IAS for invasive alien species, NEX for the Nexus, TfC for transformative change and BB for business and biodiversity (in capital letters).

| **Full Name** | **Short Name** | **Abbreviation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services | Global assessment | GA |
|    |   |   | 
| Methodological assessment regarding the diverse conceptualization of multiple values of nature and its benefits, including biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services | Values assessment | VA |
|    |   |   | 
| Thematic assessment of the sustainable use of wild species | Sustainable use assessment | SUA |
|    |   |   | 
| Thematic assessment of the interlinkages among biodiversity, water, food and health | Nexus assessment | NEX |
|    |   |   | 
| Thematic assessment of invasive alien species and their control | Invasive alien species assessment | IAS |
|    |   |   | 
| Thematic assessment of the underlying causes of biodiversity loss, determinants of transformative change and options for achieving the 2050 vision for biodiversity | Transformative change assessment | TfC |
|    |   |   | 
| Methodological Assessment of the Impact and Dependence of Business on Biodiversity and Nature’s Contributions to People | Business and biodiversity assessment | BBA |


[chapter]: chapter and subchapter number or “SPM”, e.g. “Ch5.2”. This is an optional field; if there is no chapter, use “__” (i.e. two underscores) to keep the file name machine readable.

[document_type] The kind of document it is (e.g., a meeting report, chapter or dataset). Suggested are the following types (a complete list is maintained by the data tsu):
- [figure](#figure)
- [table](#table)
- [data management report](#DMR)
- [meeting report](#MR)
- [dialogue report](#DR)
- [dataset](#dataset)

[short_description] should describe the document in preferably 1-5 words (e.g., “dialogue Asia”, “systematic review topic chapter”). Clear descriptions are much easier to use than ambiguous ones, so when it is not possible to add a description in 1-5 words, it is recommended to use more words.

[version] Version in the format as described in the versioning scheme for IPBES products. The version number indicates at which state in the assessment a file was uploaded. It is therefore important to upload a new version (with updated version in the file name) at every milestone. Access to previous versions can be restricted in order to avoid confusion.

The sections are separated with “_”, and multiple words within a section can be separated with “ ” (space).
