
#### *B. Projections*

IPBES has adopted the Robinson projection for all global scale maps. 

The Robinson projection balances distortions in area, direction, distance, and distorations near the poles. We encourage the use of Pacific centered maps when focused on marine or Pacific themes. 

For maps of countries or regions, national or appropriate regional projections are recommended. If there is no specific country projection available, the relevant Universal Transverse Mercator zone projection is suggested.

#### *C. Color Considerations*

Color is a critical key to communicating information to viewers within a map. Often incorrect color schemes are used that either make it difficult for people to understand the map or bias the interpretation. 

When creating a map, please choose color schemes that are color blindness friendly and are not rainbow colored. A very useful tool to visualize colors as someone with different types of color blindness is available [here](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40).  
 
To display no data we recommend using the color grey (BBBBBB; RGB:187, 187, 187).
